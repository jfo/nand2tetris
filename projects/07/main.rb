# the main program should construct a parser to parse the vm input file
# and a codewriter to generate code into the corresponding output file.
# it should then arch through the vm commands in the input file and generate
# assembly code for each one of them.

# if the programs argument is a directory name rather than a file name, the main program should
# should process all the .vm fies in this directory. in doing so, it should use a seperate
# Parser for each file and a single codewriter to output
